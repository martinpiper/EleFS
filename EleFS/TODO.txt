* Might want to use CommutativeEncryptBytewise() for byte wise support instead of the 32 bit chunked crypto?




* Expand the tests so that a new file system is mounted
	* Files copied into it from multiple processes (use bat files)
	* The resultant files verified
	* Unmounted
	* Remounted
	* The resultant files verified again




* Implement storage of extra file information as a generic text field in EleFS. This is to be used for file security tokens.




* Implement MirrorSetFileSecurity/MirrorGetFileSecurity using the file generic text field.
	The root of the file system, when queried, can use the file's security token.
	Remember to add the option FILE_PERSISTENT_ACLS
