* Implement FileCrypto::ReadFile/WriteFile so that it does encryption instead of just passing through data.
	BlobFile mCrypto
	For small chunk encrypted data access there will need to be a larger encrypt/decrypt operation that inctroduces some overhead.
	Can potentially cache the result of the larger block while there is a file lock.
	Might need to pass through file locking operations as well, if the multi-user shared file access functionality is still required.




* Will need to add an encryption key from the command line
	/p thePassword (Must be used before the /f option to set the container path)
* If no key on the comand line then FileCrypto can default to a plain text passthrough




* The FileCrypto needs to populate the entire buffer to the end and consider only returning the section requested if it is smaller.
	This is so the decrypt and encrypt can work on the full buffer if available.
	Then can use the 32 bit optimised encrypt functions instead.
