EleFS
=====

A long time ago, for a computer far far away, there was a blob file based file system called EleFS for the Acorn Archimedes.

This uses Dokan V1.0.0 https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases/tag/v1.0.0


Example command lines:

* /p cryptoPassword /f C:\temp\container.EleFs /l M:\ /s /d /m
* /f C:\temp\container.EleFs /l M:\ /s /d /m
* /f C:\temp\container.EleFs /l M:\ /s /m
